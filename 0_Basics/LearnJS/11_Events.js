/*
    Javascript Events are change in state of Object.
    Whenever user performs some interaction with the browser, such as button click or hover etc triggers event which is then handled by eventListener

    JS interaction with html is handled by eventListeners

    methods:-
    1. onclick()
    2. ondbclick()
    3. onchange()
    4. onmousehover()
    5. onmouseenter()
    6. onkeypress()


    Why do we need addEventListener().
    ---> To add new events we always have to open html document and put a event listener inside it. It incerase unnecessary length and increase complexity of html.

    To avoid this we use addEventListener
